The website I will be building is my portfolio, which will include my different projects, ranging from videos, photos, and websites.
I liked this portfolio (http://www.christopher-ware.com/). It has many animations and transitions while scrolling through the page, while keeping everything simple.
For my website, I wil be using more creative fonts, instead of default fonts. I will also be putting in shadows behind the images for a more 3D look.
I want to create a gallery for my photos, so I need to learn how to repeat a group of images when clicking an arrow. 
I also want to create a contact page, so I need to learn how to receive the messages through my email.
